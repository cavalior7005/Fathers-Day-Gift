# Fathers-Day-Gift
Basic movie recommendation engine
You can select a movie based on the director, duration, imdb rating, content rating, and genre. 
Please download the file "film_rec_tato.csv" and place into the appropriate folder. Someone scraped this information off of imdb's website using a program so there are some blank cells. The filtering system doesn't take into account blanks so some movies will be included in the recommendation that aren't 100% adhering to your selection.
This program, sadly, can be easily broken. Therefore, please follow the rules below:
In general:
1. Put quotes around all inputs.
2. Do not add spaces anywhere except to separate a first and last name.
3. If you do not want to use a certain criteria, input "NA" and it will not be used as a filter. 
4. Capitalize names and genres (ex. "Joss Whedon" OR "Action,Drama")
Enjoy and happy Fathers' Day!
